I would like to write a web app that takes an audio file of spoken words and does the following:
1. Converts the audio to text.
2. Plays the audio while displaying the text.
3. Iteratively improves its display of the text as it learns more about a) what the text is saying and b) what the listener prefers.
4. Can ultimately show the user a rich visual representation of the content in the text that animates in time with the playback of the audio.

Does this make sense? Do you have any clarifying questions?
