# Implementation Plan for Audio-Visualizer Web App

## Overview
This web app will process audio files of spoken words and provide a synchronized, interactive, and visually rich experience for users. The app will:
1. Convert audio to text.
2. Play the audio while displaying the text in real-time.
3. Iteratively improve its text display using LLM analysis, machine learning and user feedback.
4. Provide a rich visual representation of the text content, synchronized with the audio playback.

## Key Features and Implementation Details

### 1. Audio to Text Conversion
- **Tool/Library**: Use Whisper by OpenAI for speech-to-text conversion as it is low-cost and can run locally.
- **Implementation**: Integrate Whisper into the Django backend to process uploaded audio files.

### 2. Real-Time Text Display with Audio Playback
- **Requirement**: Display text in real-time during the first playback, even if it delays playback by a few seconds.
- **Implementation**:
  - Process the audio in chunks to enable streaming transcription.
  - Use WebSockets to send transcribed text from the backend to the frontend in real-time.
  - Synchronize text display with audio playback using timestamps.

### 3. Iterative Improvements
- **Approach**:
  - Use a local LLM like Ollama to analyze and refine the text display.
  - Collect user feedback on text accuracy and display preferences.
  - Train a lightweight model locally to adapt to user preferences over time.

### 4. Rich Visual Representation
- **Initial Version**:
  - Display well-designed sentences of the text that fade in and out, synchronized with the audio.
- **Advanced Version**:
  - Generate drawings, images, or animations based on the text content.
  - Use tools like DALLÂ·E or Stable Diffusion for image generation.
  - Allow users to customize the visual style and level of detail.

### 5. Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Vite.js for a fast and modern development experience.
- **Backend**: Django for robust and scalable server-side logic.
- **Communication**: WebSockets for real-time updates.
- **Machine Learning**: Whisper for speech-to-text, Ollama for LLM-based text analysis, and Stable Diffusion for visuals.

## Development Plan
1. **Setup**:
   - Initialize a Vite.js project for the frontend.
   - Set up a Django project for the backend.
   - Install and configure Whisper for local speech-to-text processing.
2. **Basic Functionality**:
   - Implement audio upload and transcription.
   - Display transcribed text in real-time during audio playback.
3. **Iterative Improvements**:
   - Integrate Ollama for text analysis and refinement.
   - Add user feedback mechanisms.
4. **Rich Visuals**:
   - Start with simple text animations.
   - Gradually introduce image and animation generation.
5. **Testing and Optimization**:
   - Test the app on various audio files and devices.
   - Optimize performance for real-time processing.

## Future Enhancements
- Support for multiple languages.
- Advanced customization options for visuals.
- Integration with cloud services for heavy processing tasks.

## Notes
- Focus on low-cost, local solutions to minimize expenses.
- Prioritize user experience and real-time performance.
